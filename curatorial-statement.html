          <h1>Curatorial Statement</h1>
          <p>The works in <em>Beyond Us</em> reach out, pushing through difficulties and mysteries to discover what lies
            beyond. The works question what is “beyond us,” i.e. impossible to understand or accomplish. Challenging the
            unknown is embedded in their creative process, with many of the artists experimenting with new mediums and
            expanding their realities through both grounded research and fantastical worldbuilding. They confront
            boundaries: where light becomes shadow, limitations of bodies and minds, horizons. Some of the works utilize
            motion tracking, pulling us into their worlds to uncover their secrets; others tell stories through
            animation,
            taking us on reflective journeys.

            <em>RVEN NIGHT</em> by Amely Gonell invites us to fly the night sky as a raven while the moon is high and
            freely poop on the civilians below, changing the trajectory of their life or letting them go about their day
            in a pixel simulation. <em>Rivers Reflect the Stars</em> by Anika Rios and Cindy Qiu travels beyond the
            atmosphere to a planet uncharted yet eerily familiar, wandering in the periphery of the known universe as a
            reminder that we are as much strangers to the larger universe as it is to us. <em>Shortie</em> by Allison
            Lai
            follows a small girl's adventure through a hostile, dreamlike world, highlighting the spirit of perseverance
            and interpersonal connection in overcoming obstacles that seem impossible. <em>Ghost in the Machine</em> by
            Dylan Shalmer explores the feeling of touching the fabric of time, engaging with a past that refuses to
            fade.
            <em>What You Can't See</em> by Shaima Rini illuminates the corners of a dark childhood bedroom, playing with
            our fear of what might be hiding just beyond the light.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the works in <em>Beyond Us</em> muse at the edges of what we believe to be possible, they acknowledge the
            things we find could be beautiful and affirming, or odd and dangerous. Returning to the imagination of a
            child
            lying in bed staring into the limitless dark, we may drift off to dreams or nightmares. As long as we keep
            pushing forward, our universe has the potential to expand endlessly—but who knows what lies beyond us?
